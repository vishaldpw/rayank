we can set the inventory file from static to dynamic using a script that returns us alist of end servers 
for example to run a playbook to a particular set of inventory that is set in a static file we use:-
ansible -playbook -i inventory.txt healthcheck.yml 

but suppose if your inventory changes everyday and on each day you I new set on server in inventory then we can use a python script to return us a fresh list of inventory 
and we can run the playbook 

ansible-playbook -i pythonScript.py healthcheck.yml
